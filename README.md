# BarbezDotEu.Ole

This project is a .NET library targeting **.NET Standard 2.0**.  
It provides types for OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) interop and command definitions.

## Target Framework

- .NET Standard 2.0

## Classes and Enums

### OLECMD

The `OLECMD` class represents an OLE command structure, typically used for interop scenarios.

- **cmdID**: The command ID (integer).
- **cmdf**: Flags associated with the command ID (integer).

---

### OLECMDID

The `OLECMDID` enum specifies OLE command IDs, such as those used in Microsoft Visual Studio OLE interop.

**Example values:**
- `OLECMDID_OPEN`
- `OLECMDID_SAVE`
- `OLECMDID_COPY`
- `OLECMDID_PASTE`
- `OLECMDID_UNDO`
- ...and more

**Usage Example:**

---

### IOleCommandTarget

The `IOleCommandTarget` interface represents the COM interface for command execution and status queries.  
It is used to query the status of commands and to execute commands in OLE/COM interop scenarios.

#### Methods

- `int QueryStatus(ref Guid pguidCmdGroup, int cCmds, OLECMD prgCmds, IntPtr pCmdText)`  
  Queries the object for the status of one or more commands generated by user interface events.

  - **pguidCmdGroup**: The GUID of the command group.
  - **cCmds**: The number of commands.
  - **prgCmds**: An array of OLECMD structures for which status is needed.
  - **pCmdText**: Pointer for returning command text/status (can be null).
  - **Returns**: `S_OK` on success, or an error code.

- `int Exec(ref Guid pguidCmdGroup, int nCmdID, int nCmdexecopt, object[] pvaIn, int pvaOut)`  
  Executes the specified command.

  - **pguidCmdGroup**: The GUID of the command group.
  - **nCmdID**: The command ID.
  - **nCmdexecopt**: Execution options.
  - **pvaIn**: Input arguments.
  - **pvaOut**: Output arguments.
  - **Returns**: `S_OK` on success, or an error code.

> **Note:** This interface is intended for advanced COM interop scenarios and is typically implemented or consumed via interop with OLE/ActiveX components.
